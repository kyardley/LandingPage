            <p>Travel <br>
            I take advantage of every travel opportunity that is placed before me.  My most recent travel experience was a cross-country roadtrip with two friends.  We drove through 24 states and the main cities that we visited are as follows: Chicago, Niagra Falls, Boston, New York, Philydelphia, and Washington DC.  </p>
            <p>Fishing <br>
            One of my favorite childhood memories is waking up early and going fishing with my dad.  We have this special lake in Southern Utah called Kent's Lake. We still go fishing there everytime I visit home!
